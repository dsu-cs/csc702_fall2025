Our goal was to use a clustering model to try to find well-defined, then use the offsets between the center of the clusters to determine the relationship between the clusters.

We discovered that clustering algorithms did not perform well on our word embedings by means of finding compact, distinct clusters of words.
So, the offsets between the group centers did not provide insight on the relations of the clusters since the clusters themselves were ill defined.

The jupyter notebook file illustrates the process of our discoveries.
